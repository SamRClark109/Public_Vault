- # üëã Welcome to the homepage of my mind!
	- Hello there! Welcome to my [[second brain]]! This is a collection of all my thoughts, interests and experiences.
	- I am trying to capture my thoughts and experiences to share with anyone that might be similarly minded in the hope others may be able to learn from my experiences so far.
		- I am developing these notes as I learn over time.
	- ## How am I doing this?
		- I am doing this through using an app called [[Logseq]].
			- This is a [[Personal Knowledge Management]] [[outliner]] app that enables me to connect different notes together in a [[knowledge graph]] to help discover relationships between different things and interests. Look below for a video on how to use this platform!

- # üß≠ Finding your way around
	- This platform uses something called [[bi-directional linking]]. Basically, it is very similar to [[Wikipedia]]! Anything you see that is highlighted you can click on for more detail.
	- The main place for starting your journey is in [[üå≥ My Mind Garden]]. You can find this in my favourites pages to the left of this screen.
	- Whenever you want to find your way back üè° you can simply click the home icon top right of your page.
	- For more detail explore the following pages!

			- LATER find a picture and edit it to make a nice welcome image with a caption to the right of it.
	- My name is [[Sam]] and I have a strong passion for all things learning based. I believe that [[learning is the ultimate equaliser in society]] and that [[by harnessing the power of learning, one can craft a better future for themselves]]. This platform is my attempt at learning in public and putting one key philosophy into practice‚Ä¶. [[Writing is thinking]].
		- If this is something that resonates with you then I hope you find my mental scribbles of interest!
	- **Happy exploring, I hope you enjoy reading my thoughts as much as I enjoy developing them!**
